        Zooracle is a device that lets you take photos of animals and analyze
        their unique visual patterns. Within minutes, the software is able to tell you,
        whether an animal of a certain species, has already been found, or if it is a new individual.
        Thanks to state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, these assertions come with a very
        high accuracy, namely around 90-100%!<br>&nbsp;<br>
        
        <p><strong>Visual recognition is highly efficient, that means no more invasive marking methods are required - 
        stress may be reduced, drastically.</strong></p>

        <div class="imgtext">
          <strong>figure</strong>: the Zooracle device. A Raspberry Pi Computer with a touchscreen and a camera,
          in a custom-designed case (unit of length in centimeters).  
        </div> </center>
        
        The device consists of low-cost, yet reliable components:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Raspberry PI B+ computer</li>
          <li>LCD touchscreen (PiTFT)</li>
          <li>battery (may be charged via USB, i.e. with solar panels)</li>
          <li>5 MP camera (Raspberry Pi Cam Module, infrared optional)</li>
          <li>LED light (optional)</li>
          <li>GPS (optional)</li>
          <li>WiFi (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        Zooracle will be shipped along with the software, that will hold the following key functions:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Take a photo of an individual animal, including fully automatic image quality check</li>
          <li>Run analysis and compare new individual with individuals in the local database</li>
          <li>Let the software assert, whether the individual is new or already exists (match)</li>
          <li>Manage database entries, add descriptions and export</li>
        </ul>
        
        How does it work? Zooracle makes use of modern approaches from the field of computer vision,
        including image description and clustering algorithms. The result so far already delivers
        outstanding classification accuracies. For large-scale animal databases, machine learning
        algorithms may be utilized.

        <div class="imgtext" style="width:530px">
          <strong>figure</strong>: comparison example with yellow-bellied toads, visualizing
          good keypoint matches. On the left: two images of the same individual. On the right: different individuals.
        </div></center>
        
        Unlike the figure suggests, the photos don't necessarily have to be aligned or cropped - the software does it! Photos
        are being pre-processed, and the description of patterns is rotational invariant. The only thing you have to do is
        to take the picture.
